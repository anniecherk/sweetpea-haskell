### Disclaimer! Currently mid-refactor, this code doesn't work

SweetPea is a language for declaratively specifying randomized experimental designs, and a runtime for synthesizing trial sequences generated from the design specification; this prototype that is targeted at psychology and neuroscience experiments.

An experimental design is a description of experimental factors, relationships between factors, sequential constraints, and how to map those factors onto a sequence of trials. The reliability and validity of experimental results heavily relies on rigorous experimental design.

SweetPea provides a high-level interface to declaratively describe an experimental design, and a low-level synthesizer to generate unbiased sequences of trials given satisfiable constraints. SweetPea samples sequences of trials by compiling experimental designs into Boolean logic, which are then passed to a SAT-sampler. The SAT-sampler [Unigen](https://bitbucket.org/kuldeepmeel/unigen) provides statistical guarantees that the solutions it finds are approximately uniformly probable in the space of all valid solutions. This means that while producing sequences of trials that are perfectly unbiased is intractable, we do the next best thing-- produce sequences that are approximately unbiased.


#### Disclaimer!

This project is at an early stage, and likely to change: it isn't yet ready for real-world useage. Please don't rely on any of this code!


## Useage info!

Grab [stack](https://docs.haskellstack.org/en/stable/README/) if you don't already have it.

Grab the repo:

```
git clone https://github.com/anniecherk/sweetpea-haskell
cd sweetpea-haskell/
git submodule init
git submodule update
```

## Run an example

`./run_example.sh`

This will run the small example Stroop experiment in app/ExperimentToRun.hs, and print the generated sequence of trials to the console.

Note: you currently need to install crytominisat- this project plans to eventually rely upon Unigen, but currently uses cryptominisat, which is the solver Unigen uses. You can install it [here](https://github.com/msoos/cryptominisat).
